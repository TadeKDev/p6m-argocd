After a summer heads down, building, we are ready to take the wrapping off of Supercog AI, 
our new AI agent platform. While still rough around the edges, you can already do remarkable
things with the Supercog platform.

## A connected AI assistant
Rather than just acting as a design co-pilot, consulting on your problem, Supercog works by
getting connected **live** to all the systems in your company. Giving Supecog access
to those systems means that it can start to solve problems specific to your company, and do
so in a more much autonomous way than something like ChatGPT.

We like to think of Supercog as your **AI digital assistant** helping you out at work.
I liken Supercog to how **R2D2** works in Star Wars. He communicates fine with the humans,
but when they get into the Death Star R2 goes and plugs into the "computer port" and starts
communicating with the master commputer.

Beyond those system connections, we have given Supercog just a ton of raw capabilities:

- Image recognition
- Image generation
- Text to speech
- Ability to search the web, browse the web, take web screenshots
- Understands docs in any format
- Connectors not just to apps, but databases and data warehouses
- A suite of developer tools like the REST API tool, DuckDB tool, and Code Interpreter
- GenAI tools like Retrieval Augmented Generation

It's possibly **too much** power, honestly! But the truth is that now we are deep
in process of showing people how they can use Supercog at work, with lots and lots of
examples. 

## What can I do with this thing?
Here are just some of the ways people can use Supercog today:

- Copy a set of issues from JIRA into Saleforce, transforming them into the structure of the Salesforce _Case_ object, with this prompt:

  ```
  If you are asked to copy data from JIRA to Salesforce then do this:
  1. Retrieve the record schemas from JIRA and Salesforce and compare them
  2. Download all the records from JIRA into duckdb
  3. Transform the records into Salesforce schema
  4. Upsert all records into Salesforce
  ```

- Create a morning news [audio stream](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YyRpqdpnWZLpeqI62mEi9yPyPJiq5qTF/view?usp=sharing) taken from the day's top headlines
- Have Supercog do extensive web research when you are meeting with someone new and send you a "meeting prep" report.
- Build a RAG chatbot from a set of web pages with just a simple set of English instructions.
- Prepare a deep research [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18ZUf7Krt2l-zmL3yDKvKb-cqBqMm3jF_/view?usp=sharing) on any topic.
- Export data from any system in CSV with a couple simple commands
- Apply image recoginition to a complex PDF form to extract useable data into a spreadsheet

## Just getting started
The platform is still in such an early state, but we can already see a world where
Supercog can connect to _any system_, understand any file or image, and help with
a myriad of "glue" tasks at work.
