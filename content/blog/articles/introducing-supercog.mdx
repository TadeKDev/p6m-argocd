I am really excited to announce the launch of our new startup, Supercog.ai.

My co-founder in this new venture is a great friend of mine (and a
former co-founder partner), Alex Osborne. Alex and I have worked
around the application integration space for a long time, and we are
unrealistically excited about applying the GenAI stack to this
and other problems in the modern workplace.

## Realizing the promise of enterprise AI
Modern Large Language Models are marvels of engineering. And ChatGPT and
Claude have shown the utility these models for lots of everyday tasks when
they are combined with a simple UI.

But when I use ChatGPT at work, it feels sort of like I'm hiring a consultant.
They can give me lots of great advice, but I am still the one doing the work.
So Alex and I asked ourselves - how could we use AI to **do** more of the 
work for us?

With our backgrounds in integration, our first thought was that the LLM 
needed to be **connected** to all your systems at work. At any modern company
**everything** runs through some applicatiomn or document or database.
So if we could connect the smarts of the LLM to the real systems and data (both
structured and unstructured) that you use at work, then we could unleash the
power of that reasoning engine to help you accomplish real tasks.

## The Last Platform Shift
I like to call the AI revolution "the last platform shift". That may
turn out to be hyperbole, but I definitely believe we are in the
very early stages of seeing what this new stack can enable. I know
we are hardly the first folks to claim that "amazing stuff is
coming!". But this is why Alex and I are focused on delivering a product 
the solves real problems in a tangible way. 

## What's Next
We will have much more to share about this new platform soon. In the
meantime, if you're interested in getting a peek - or even better if
you have data processing tasks that you would like
some help with - please reach out because we want to help.
