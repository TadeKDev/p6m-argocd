I wanted to share a little bit about the philosophy for _why_ we built Supercog.

We believe that Language Language Models (LLMs) are **power tools** that offer 
amazing capabilities to people that know how to use them. But so far these tools are mostly
helping the software engineers. We set out to help _everyone else_ get leverage
out of this technology.

We don't think AI is ready to replace anyone's job, and frankly we aren't interested 
in replacing jobs. But we do think that AI systems can be offloading a lot of 
dreary tasks that absorb some portion of everyone's work day. Searching for information,
collating and summarizing it, moving info from point A to point B, visualizing info, 
or delivering the right info to the right person at the right time - these are all tasks
that people spend some amount of time on, and some people spend LOTS of time on some
versions of these tasks.

## Your Digital Office Assistant

The language abilities of the LLM makes it amazing for dealing with unstructured 
data like emails, and for understanding instructions in plain English. If you
can put an LLM into your organization with access to lots of information, it can be
very useful at quickly digging up the answer to lots of questions. And this has been
the initial "killer app" for LLMs in the enterprise - "like ChatGPT but with my 
private company info". 

But beyond answering questions, the frontier (the "leading edge") models can also
dissect and analyze data from documents. You can ask your LLM to summarize info
from long docs, or to extract useful facts like interpreting a chart or scanning
through the rows of a spreadsheet.

And thus _talk to my docs_ and deeper analysis are becoming additional popular use
cases for using LLMs at work.

## The move to agents

The _reasoning_ capabilities of the LLM is what really triggered our early excitement
about building this platform. It turns out that an LLM is quite good at devising
a _plan_ to solve a task, and then _executing that plan_ using a set of **tools** that
you give it to _take action_. With these capabilities we realized that Supercog
could actually take _action_ and perform work on your behalf, simply by following
the English instructions that you give it.

All we had to do was to give the LLM a large set of _tools_, and it would be able
to accomplish real work at the office. Because where do most "knowledge workers"
spend their time during the day? They spend a lot of it using the various SaaS
tools of the modern workplace. Google Docs/Office 360/Email/Slack/Salesforce/JIRA -
this is where a lot of modern work gets done. So if we can connect our "LLM powered"
agent to  these systems, then it should be able to accomplish real work for us.

So this was the vision for Supercog, to unleash the power of the LLM - safely! - within
the enterprise to give every person the chance to use these new "bicycles for the mind"
as Jobs would put it.
